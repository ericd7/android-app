# Android Game

A simple Android game application template built with Kotlin.

## Project Structure

This project follows the standard Android application structure:

- `app/src/main/java/com/example/androidgame/`: Contains the Kotlin source code
  - `MainActivity.kt`: The entry point of the application
  - `GameActivity.kt`: Hosts the game view
  - `GameView.kt`: Renders the game and handles user input
  - `GameThread.kt`: Manages the game loop
- `app/src/main/res/`: Contains resources like layouts, strings, and drawables
  - `layout/`: XML layout files
  - `values/`: String, color, and style definitions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or newer
- Android SDK 21 or higher
- Kotlin 1.8.10 or newer

### Building the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync the project with Gradle files
4. Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device

## Game Development

This template provides the basic structure for an Android game:

- A game loop that maintains a consistent frame rate
- Surface view for efficient rendering
- Touch event handling
- Activity lifecycle management

To develop your game:

1. Modify the `GameView.update()` method to update your game state
2. Modify the `GameView.draw()` method to render your game elements
3. Add game objects and logic as needed
